## Loans:
Loans have the same concepts like annuities  with payments made at intervals.

Some Terminology:

$B_t$ : Amount of outstanding loan at time t.
$I_t$ : Amount of interest incurred at time t.
$P_t$ : Amount of principal to be paid at time t.
$R_t$: Amount of Money paid at time t.


Formulas:

Retrospective Method;
$$
B_t = L.(1+i)^t-R.S_t
$$
Prospective Method:
$$
B_t = R.a_{n-t}
$$
$$
I_t= B_{t-1}.i
$$
$$
B_t= B_{t-1}-P_t
$$
$$
P_t= R_{t}-I_t
$$

## Amortization Table:

| Duration | Principal Repaid | Interest | Loan Payment | Outstanding payment |
| -------- | ---------------- | -------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
|          |                  |          |              |                     |
This is the proforma for loan repayment amortization.

The loan repayments can have Level as well as non-level payments.
